                        This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from (the “Site”).
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
                        <br>
                        When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information
                        about
                        your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.
                        Additionally, as you
                        browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites
                        or
                        search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
                        automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</h4>
                        <br>
                        - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type,
                        Internet
                        service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.<br>
                        - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
                        Site.
                        <br><br>
                        When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information
                        and Order
                        Information.

                        <h4>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h4>
                        <br>
